# Now write a similar game to the one that I created in the last exercise.
# It can be any kind of game you want in the same flavor.
# Spend a week on it making it as interesting as possible.
# For Study Drills, use lists, functions, and modules
# (remember those from Exercise 13?) as much as possible,
# and find as many new pieces of Python as you can to make the game work.
